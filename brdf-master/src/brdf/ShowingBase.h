/*
This is a simple base class inherited by different widgets and windows.

The problem: we won't want to waste a lot of time drawing GL stuff on widgets
that aren't actually visible (because they're hidden away in an unselected tab).

Unfortunately, Qt doesn't seem to offer a clean way for widgets to know whether they're
they're actually visible - isVisible() and friends tell you a tab is visible when it's
clearly not. This class is a way of handling that; it stores visibility and updates
visibility state. ShowingDockWidget handles QDockWidget's visibilityChanged() messages
and calls this class's setShowing() method. If the widget is actually a QWidget (not a GL
widget) it passes it through to the GL widget.

The GL widget can then freely ignore GL paint requests when isShowing() returns false.
